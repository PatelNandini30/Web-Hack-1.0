            <p>
              Harassment is any behavior that makes someone uncomfortable, as it relates to protected characteristics. It can occur in both public and private places. Harassment cases are rising in the workplace despite the effort by the government to enact laws that help reduce harassment. All employees in a workplace must know what constitutes sexual harassment. Any unwelcome physical, verbal, or visual behavior in a working institution falls under the definition of workplace sexual harassment.
              Visual harassment is a situation where the individual exposes themselves to another person without the victim's consent, and the act affects their work performance or attitude. Examples of visual harassment include:
              Exposing of private parts
              Sending sexual images or videos to another person. For instance, sending unsolicited pornographic videos to another person through a social website
              Unwelcome gestures towards another person
              Staring at someone else’s body offensively and making the person feel uncomfortable
              Placing a poster with information related to sexual behaviors
              Exposing someone else’s private pictures or images without their consent
              Displaying abusive or inappropriate messages or content from a website, book, or magazine.

              Verbal harassment is a type of non-physical harassment that makes employees feel less comfortable, humiliated, threatened, or intimidated. Most of the time,
              people find it challenging to identify verbal harassment because of different reactions among other colleagues. The most common forms of verbal harassment include:
              Making inappropriate jokes, remarks, teasing, or asking sexually related questions
              Asking someone at work to go out with you, unwelcome sexual advances, and sexual favors
              Inquiring about the sexual preference or history of a colleague at the workplace
              Gossiping about someone and spreading lies about them
              Using abusive language and offensive name-calling
              Commenting negatively about a person’s clothing, body, or personal behavior
              Making inappropriate sounds such as kissing sounds, whistling, or smacking lips
              Sending someone sexual emails, notes, or letters
              Verbal attacks such as arguing with someone using threatening, discriminatory, or demeaning words
              Embarrassing someone in front of people, like an employer shouting and yelling at an employee over poor performance Please note that the law does
              not consider
              all verbal harassment forms illegal unless it appears unlawful under the rule of law. When verbal abuse is not illegal, the victim can talk to the abuser and explain how the words make them uncomfortable.

              Quid pro quo sexual harassment is a type of workplace sexual harassment in which an employee’s submission to or rejection of a superior’s sexual demands affects employment decisions, either positively or negatively.It typically involves an employee being pressured by a superior to provide sexual favors in order to avoid being fired or
              demoted, or in order to get a promotion, raise or perk.
              Even if the superior doesn’t intend to follow through on the implied threat or benefit, the perception by the victim that the threat or benefit is real constitutes quid pro quo sexual harassment.Quid pro quo sexual harassment is a type of workplace sexual harassment in which an employee’s submission to or rejection of a superior’s sexual demands affects employment
              decisions, either positively or negatively.
              Prevention and Response: Employers have a legal obligation to prevent and address instances of quid pro quo harassment in the workplace. This includes implementing clear policies prohibiting harassment, providing training to employees and supervisors on appropriate workplace behavior, establishing mechanisms
              for reporting harassment, and conducting prompt and thorough investigations of complaints.

            <p>
              A hostile work environment is typically defined by law as a workplace where discriminatory conduct or behavior of a severe or pervasive nature interferes with an individual's ability to perform their job effectively.It often involves harassment based on protected characteristics such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability,
              or other factors protected by law. Harassment can be verbal, physical, visual, or written and can include offensive jokes, slurs, intimidation, or other unwelcome behavior.A
              hostile work environment can have serious consequences for employees, including psychological distress, decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, and ultimately, resignation. It can also lead to legal action against the employer.Employers have a legal responsibility to prevent and address harassment and
              discrimination in the workplace. They must establish clear policies prohibiting such behavior, provide training to employees and managers, promptly investigate complaints,
              and take appropriate disciplinary action against offenders
              .Employers who fail to address
              a hostile work environment may face legal consequences, including lawsuits, fines, and damage to their reputation. Employees who experience
              harassment or discrimination may file complaints with government agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).A hostile work environment may also be created when management acts in a manner designed to make an employee quit in retaliation for some action. For example, if an employee reported safety
              violations at work, was injured, attempted to join a union, or reported regulatory violations by management, and management's response was to harass and pressure the employee to quit. Employers have tried to force employees to quit by imposing unwarranted discipline, reducing hours, cutting wages, or transferring the
              complaining employee to a distant work location.

              he use of digital technology has become an integral part of our lives. Any technology can be used for constructive or destructive purposes.
              Misuse of information and communication technology is an important ingredient of Cyber Crime. Cyber harassment encompasses a wide range of behavior
              s conducted through digital platforms such as social media, email, messaging apps, online forums, and gaming platforms. It includes actions like
              sending threatening messages, spreading rumors, sharing personal information without consent, creating fake profiles to impersonate or humiliate
              others, and posting offensive or inflammatory content.Cyber harassment can take various forms, including trolling, cyberstalking, doxxing (posting
              private or sensitive information about someone online), revenge porn (sharing explicit images or videos without consent), and hate speech
              (targeting individuals or groups based on characteristics such as race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation).The impact of cyber harassment
              can be severe and wide-ranging. Victims may experience emotional distress, anxiety, depression, and in extreme cases, self-harm or suicide. It
              can also harm professional reputations, damage relationships, and interfere with daily life activities. Cyber harassment can affect individuals
              of all ages, but it is particularly prevalent among children, teenagers, and marginalized communities.Laws and regulations related to cyber
              harassment vary by jurisdiction, but many countries have enacted legislation to address online abuse and protect victims' rights. Legal
              remedies may include civil lawsuits, criminal charges for harassment or defamation, restraining orders, and the removal of offensive content by
              internet service providers or social media platforms. cyber harassment requires a combination of legal measures, technological solutions, and
              \education initiatives. Individuals can protect themselves by setting privacy settings on social media accounts, avoiding engaging with harassers,
              and reporting abusive behavior to platform administrators. Organizations and online communities should implement clear policies against cyber
              harassment,
              provide support resources for victims, and take swift action to address instances of abuse.

            <p>
              At freeBe, we take bullying and harassment situations seriously. Bullying and harassment is a unique challenge and one of the most complex
              issues to address because context is critical. We work hard to enforce against this content while also equipping our community with tools
              to protect themselves in ways that work best for them.
              We're always creating new resources and tools, and revising policies with expert help to continually tackle the issue.
              Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, from making threats and releasing personally identifiable information to
              sending threatening messages and making unwanted malicious contact.
              We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people
              who are featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we remove attacks that are severe, as well as certain attacks
              where the public figure is directly tagged in the post or comment. We define public figures as state- and national-level government officials, political
              candidates for those offices, people with over one million fans or followers on social media and people who receive substantial news coverage.

              For private individuals, our protection goes further: We remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for example, claims about
              someone's personal sexual activity. We recognise that bullying and harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our
              policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18.

              Discriminatory harassment can take many forms. It may be, but is not limited to: words, signs, jokes, pranks, intimidation,
              physical contact, or violence. It also may include harassment that is sexual in nature or directed at the gender of another
              (as in sexual harassment).Discriminatory harassment occurs when individuals or groups are subjected to offensive, intimidating,
              or hostile behavior based on their membership in a protected class. This can include verbal or physical conduct, as well as non-verbal
              actions such as gestures, symbols, or written communications, that create a hostile or intimidating environment.Discriminatory harassment
              can manifest in various forms, ranging from subtle acts of exclusion or microaggressions to overt acts of discrimination and violence. Examples
              include racial slurs, religious intolerance, sexist jokes or comments, sexual advances or propositions, age-related derogatory remarks, and
              disability-related mockery or ridicule.Discriminatory harassment can have profound emotional, psychological, and professional consequences
              for victims. It undermines their sense of dignity, safety, and belonging in the workplace, educational institutions, public spaces, or online
              communities. Victims may experience stress, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and physical health problems as a result of ongoing
              harassment.Laws and regulations in many countries prohibit discriminatory harassment and provide legal remedies for victims. These laws
              typically include provisions under civil rights legislation, employment regulations, educational policies, and anti-discrimination statutes.
              Victims of discriminatory harassment may file complaints with relevant authorities, pursue civil litigation against perpetrators or
              institutions, or seek redress through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.Preventing discriminatory harassment requires a
              multifaceted approach that addresses both individual behavior and systemic issues.
