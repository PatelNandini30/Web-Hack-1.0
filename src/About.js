            <p>
              We envision a world where every individual feels safe, respected, and
              valued, free from the threat of sexual harassment. Our vision is to
              create a culture of accountability, empathy, and inclusivity, where
              harassment is not tolerated and survivors are supported with dignity and
              compassion.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want  to make it so that everyone can feel comfortable reporting any form of inappropriate behavior without fear
              At Rise Up Collective, we believe that everyone has the right to be treated
              without fear of retaliation or intimidation for speaking out against
              injustice, regardless of their gender. We aim to provide a platform for those who have experienced sexual harassment or assault to share their
              injustice.
            </p>
